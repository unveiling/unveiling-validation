== Build steps

=== Versioning

When building you should first make sure that the pom and manifest versions are compatible.

When pom versions end with `-SNAPSHOT`, `Bundle-Version` in all MANIFEST.MF files should end with `.qualifier`.
When pom versions don't have `-SNAPSHOT`, remove `.qualifier` in MANIFEST files.

=== Building

You can build it yourself with following command inside the cdo-maven folder:

```
$ mvn clean install
```

=== Releasing

> Only for contributors.

Before releasing on maven central, make sure that pom versions end with `-SNAPSHOT` and
MANIFEST versions *do not end* with `.qualifier`, but have the correct release version number.

To release on Bintray, execute:

[source,shell]
----
mvn release:clean release:prepare
----

followed by:

[source,shell]
----
mvn release:perform
----

=== Update POM and MANIFEST.MF versions

[source,shell]
----
mvn versions:set -DnewVersion=1.10.0 -DautoVersionSubmodules=true
mvn -f org.eclipse.emf.validation/org.eclipse.emf.validation.p2/ tycho-versions:set-version -D newVersion=1.10.0
mvn -f org.eclipse.emf.validation/org.eclipse.emf.validation.p2/ tycho-versions:update-eclipse-metadata
